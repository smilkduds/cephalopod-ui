# cephalopod-ui
UI modifications for 7 Days to Die.

The stock UI for 7 Days to Die is simple, with a lot of data relevant to the
player visible only in menu screens. The goal of Cephalopod is to bring some of
those data elements out of the menu and onto the normal player HUD for less
time needing to swap out of the playing view and into menus, potentially leading
to an untimely demise at the hands of a rotting bag of walking meat.

## Features
* Compass - a center crosshair is added to the compass to give the player a
better view of their heading.
* Days survived and current time - moved to under the compass and spread out,
also the color is changed to better stand out.

* Item quality colors - changed to be more in tune with classic RPG item quality
colors.

|Color  |7 Days to Die |Classic RPG |
|-------|--------------|------------|
|Grey   |Broken        |Worthless   |
|White  |Faulty        |Common      |
|Green  |Poor          |Uncommon    |
|Blue   |Good          |Rare        |
|Purple |Fine          |Epic        |
|Orange |Great         |Legendary   |
|Cyan   |Flawless      |Mythic      |

* Health and Stamina - moved from lower left to above the toolbelt. Again like a
common RPG interface.
* Experience - added an experience level bar and current level.
* Food and Water - got thirst? Now you can see at a quick glance where you stand
on your dietary needs. Remember a hungry survivor, is a dead survivor.
* Climate information - current air temperature, wind speed, and elevation are
positioned on the right side of the toolbelt.

## Planned Features
The following are features currently in development.

* Active de/buffs - window showing the active buffs and debuffs, their name, and
time duration remaining.
* Current item ammo - moving this element from the lower right corner to a more
centered position. So you can more easily tell if you have just run out of ammo
and should club your partner in the knees or make a stand worthy of the Alamo.
* Quest tracking - tidy up the screen a bit.
