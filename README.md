UI modifications for 7 Days to Die.

Version: 2.1

The stock UI for 7 Days to Die is simple, with a lot of data relevant to the
player visible only behind menu screens. The goal of Cephalopod is to bring some
of those data elements out of the menus and onto the normal player HUD. Less
time needing to swap in and out of the playing view and menus, means less time
potentially leading to an untimely demise at the hands of a rotting bag of
walking meat.

## Features
* Compass - a center crosshair is added to the compass to give the player a
better view of their heading.
* Days survived and current time - moved to under the compass and spread out,
also the color is changed to better stand out.
* Player information - current level, health, stamina and xp progression bar are
added to the upper left of the window.
* Food and Water - got thirst? Now you can see at a quick glance where you stand
on your dietary needs. Remember a hungry survivor, is a dead survivor.
* Climate information - current air temperature, player core temperature, wind
speed, and elevation are positioned on the left side of the window.
* Current item ammo - moving this element from the lower right corner to a more
centered position. So you can more easily tell if you have just run out of ammo
and should pull a Shane on Otis or make a stand worthy of the Alamo.
* Collected items - frame for the items you collect has been enlarged so you can
see them better.
* Active de/buffs - frame moved down to lower right corner of the window, and
also has been enlarged.

## Planned Features
The following are features currently in development.

* Active de/buffs - window showing the active buffs and debuffs, their name, and
time duration remaining. Currently there is an issue (noted in numerous UI mods
and forum posts) that a client side CTD occurs if this is done and used on a
dedicated multiplayer server. Still need to actually test this out.
* Quest tracking - tidy up the frame a bit.

## Installation
1. Navigate to Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Data\Config
2. Copy files into this directory
3. Override any files
4. Done! Launch and play, no need for a new game either.

To Uninstall, right click on 7 Days To Die in your Steam library and select
properties. Click on the Local Files tab. Select 'Verify Integrity of Game
Files'. (This will return the game back to original installation so any mods
would need to be reinstalled.)
