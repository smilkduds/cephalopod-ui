# cephalopod-ui
UI modifications for 7 Days to Die.

Version: 3.0

The stock UI for 7 Days to Die is simple, with a lot of data relevant to the
player visible only behind menu screens. The goal of Cephalopod is to bring some
of those data elements out of the menus and onto the normal player HUD. Less
time needing to swap in and out of the playing view and menus, means less time
potentially leading to an untimely demise at the hands of a rotting bag of
walking meat.

## Features
* Compass - a center crosshair is added to the compass to give the player a
better view of their heading.
* Days survived and current time - moved to sides of the compass, also the color
is changed to better stand out.
* Player information - health and stamina bars are redesigned and placed just
left of the toolbelt.
* Experience - bar above toolbelt indicating the progress to the next player
level.
* Food and Water - got thirst? Now you can see at a quick glance to the right of
the toolbelt will show where you stand on your dietary needs. Remember a hungry
survivor, is a dead survivor.
* Climate information - current air temperature and player core temperature are
positioned just above the player information on the left of the toolbelt.
* Player level - added this to the right side of the experience bar.
* Current item ammo - moved this element from the lower right corner to a more
central position, above the food/water bars on the right. So you can more easily
tell if you have just run out of ammo and should pull a Shane on Otis or make a
stand worthy of the Alamo.
* Collected Items - frame for the items you collect has been enlarged so you can
see them better.
* Active de/buffs - frame moved down to lower right corner of the window, and
also has been enlarged.

* Crafting/Scrapping slots - added a 5th crafting/scrapping slot. This also
applies to all crafting windows, not just player.

## Planned Features
The following are features currently in development.

* Active de/buffs - window showing the active buffs and debuffs, their name, and
time duration remaining. Currently there is an issue (noted in numerous UI mods
and forum posts) that a client side CTD occurs if this is done and used on a
dedicated multiplayer server. Still need to actually test this out.
* Quest tracking - tidy up the frame a bit.
* Minibike storage - increase by 1-2 columns.

## Installation
1. Navigate to `Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\`
2. Copy files into this directory correct directories
  * Data: These are the UI XML files, and will be pushed by a server
3. Override any files
4. Done! Launch and play, no need for a new game either.

To Uninstall, right click on 7 Days To Die in your Steam library and select
properties. Click on the Local Files tab. Select 'Verify Integrity of Game
Files'. (This will return the game back to original installation so any mods
would need to be reinstalled.)
